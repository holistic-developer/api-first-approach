# API First Approach

<!--
approach to build software 
that is interacted with via rest apis = Backends
Frontend devs don't zone out now

no new programming language
language agnostic way to describe apis

nothing new / still not common practice

who am I to talk about this

<!--
I built frontends and backends with various languages and frameworks

Of the 2 hard problems in software engineering...

naming is my favorite one

I like things that are well documented

what I don't like are abbreviations

<h1>API <span v-click="1">(A<span v-click="2">pplication</span> P<span v-after="2">rogramming</span> I<span v-after="2">nterface</span>)</span></h1>

<p v-click="3">
API <strong>specification</strong> = <strong>description</strong> of an API
</p>

<!--
Who knows the abbreviation

Why would we start with a description?
Isn't this a waste of time?
Can't this be generated afterward?

API First = start thinking about API before the implementation

you would also do this inside your code

<p><span class="blue">getUser</span>(<span v-after="1" class="green">email: String</span>):<span class="purple" v-after="2">User</span> { ... }</p>

<!--
like writing a function signature before writing its implementation

this requires both FE and BE devs to sit together

how do frontends talk to backends?

no chatty, no cumbersome

forms a contract

# REST (REpresentational State Transfer)

<v-clicks>

**Transfer** a **representation** of the **state** of some resource

| **Action**     | **Request Method** |
|:---------------|:-------------------|
| ‚ú® **C**reate   | POST               |
| üëÄ **R**ead    | GET                |
| üìù **U**pdate  | PATCH / PUT        |
| üóëÔ∏è **D**elete | DELETE             |

</v-clicks>

<!--
transfer the data using http

manipulate state of resources ‚Üí HTTP methods

response: payload
status codes

idempotent = can I do it multiple times without changing the server state

but were can we find the resources
-->

<!--
parts of the path can be variable

hostname points to a server

path is locating a resource on that server

wasn't there something about representation?
-->

# Media Types

<v-clicks>

Representation is controlled by the <strong class="green">accept</strong> header

`text/html`

`image/jpeg`

`application/json`
</v-clicks>

<!--
Also known as MIME types
= Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME type

how are resources represented

type / subtype

# Versioning

In the host name<p class="mono"><strong class="blue">api-v2</strong>.example.com/resource</p>

In the path <p class="mono">api.example.com/<strong class="blue">v2</strong>/resource</p>

In the query <p class="mono">api.example.com/resource<strong class="blue">?version=2</strong></p>

<!--
api version is different than service version

one of them is my preferred way to go

all of them have their pros and cons

think of versioning before you need versioning

after reading the specs
don't get lost / overwelmed

you are not alone in this

many great developers think hard about how to build good apis

some of them even publish their thoughts
